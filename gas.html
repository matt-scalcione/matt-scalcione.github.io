<h1>Hybrid (Gas + Heat Pump) vs Standard Furnace</h1>

<p>If both heating systems claim 97% efficiency, why should you care whether it uses just gas or a hybrid system with a heat pump?</p>

<h2>üî• Gas Furnace vs ‚ö° Hybrid System</h2>

<table>
    <tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Standard Gas Furnace</th><th>Hybrid (Gas + Heat Pump)</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Primary Fuel</td><td>Natural gas or propane</td><td>Electricity (heat pump) + gas backup</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Heating Efficiency</td><td>AFUE 92‚Äì97%</td><td>AFUE 97% (gas) + COP 2‚Äì3 (electric)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Electric Heating Efficiency</td><td>N/A</td><td>200‚Äì300% efficient on mild days</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Winter Behavior</td><td>Always burns gas to heat</td><td>Uses electric heat pump unless it's too cold, then switches to gas</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Energy Cost Flexibility</td><td>Always gas</td><td>Chooses cheaper fuel (gas or electric)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Environmental Impact</td><td>Higher (burns fossil fuel year-round)</td><td>Lower (electric most of the time)</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>‚ö° Why You Should Care About Hybrid Systems</h2>

<p>Even if two systems both claim 97% efficiency:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A gas furnace with 97% AFUE is efficient, but it‚Äôs still burning fuel 100% of the time.</li>
    <li>A hybrid system uses a heat pump for most of the year‚Äîwhich is 2‚Äì3x more efficient than even a 97% furnace.</li>
    <li>Only when it gets very cold does the hybrid system switch to gas, making it the best of both worlds.</li>
</ul>

<h2>üîç Example:</h2>
<p>If electric rates are low and it's 45¬∞F outside, your hybrid heat pump might be heating your home at the cost of just <strong>1/3 of what gas would cost</strong>. You won‚Äôt see that savings if you're using a gas furnace only, no matter how efficient.</p>

<div class="note">
    <strong>Bottom Line:</strong><br>
    A gas furnace with 97% AFUE is great.<br>
    But a <strong>hybrid system</strong> may cost <strong>less to run</strong> year-round and helps you <strongfuture-proof your home</strong> as energy prices change.
</div>

<p>If you care about operating cost, fuel flexibility, or emissions‚Äîhybrid wins.</p>
