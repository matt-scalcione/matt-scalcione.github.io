# matt-scalcione.github.io

The main branch has been cleared so a brand-new GitHub Pages experience can be built from scratch.

## Current site status

A lightweight holding page lives at [`index.html`](index.html). Replace or expand on this file as you develop the refreshed website.

## Previous site backup

The entire legacy site is preserved on the `backup-old-site` branch. Check out that branch locally if you need to reference or restore the prior implementation:

```bash
git checkout backup-old-site
```

From there you can inspect the archived project files or cherry-pick portions into the new build as needed.
