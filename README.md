# matt-scalcione.github.io

This repository has been reset to provide a clean foundation for the next version of the site.

## Current site

The live content is a simple holding page stored at [`index.html`](index.html). Update or replace this file (and add any supporting assets) as you build the new experience.

## Backup of the previous site

A full snapshot of the earlier GitHub Pages site is preserved under [`backups/site-backup-2025-11-08`](backups/site-backup-2025-11-08/). That archive includes the entire project structure, assets, and configuration that existed before this reset.

To restore any part of the old site:

1. Copy the desired files from the backup directory back into the repository root (or another working location).
2. Commit the restored files, or use them as reference material for the new build.

> **Note:** Ignored directories such as `node_modules/` are not included in the snapshot. Install dependencies with your package manager of choice if you recreate the previous build.
